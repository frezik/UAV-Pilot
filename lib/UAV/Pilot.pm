=head1 NAME

  UAV::Pilot - Base library for controlling UAVs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This library does not support controlling any UAVs on its own.  Rather, it 
provides the basic support for implementing other UAV libraries, much the same 
way DBI provides support for implementing different database drivers.

If you would like to control the Parrot AR.Drone, you should also install 
L<UAV::Pilot::ARDrone>, and probably L<UAV::Pilot::SDL> and 
L<UAV::Pilot::Video::Ffmpeg> as well.
