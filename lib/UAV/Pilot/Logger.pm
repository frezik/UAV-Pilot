=head1 NAME

  UAV::Pilot::Logger

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Moose role for L<UAV::Pilot> classes that want to log things.

Provides the attribute C<_logger>, which returns a L<Log::Log4perl::Logger> for 
your object.

Also provides a method C<_logger_name> for fetching the logger name.  This will 
be your class's name by default.  Override as you see fit.
