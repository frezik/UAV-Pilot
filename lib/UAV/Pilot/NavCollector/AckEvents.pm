=head1 NAME

  UAV::Pilot::NavCollector::AckEvents

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   my $easy_event = UAV::Pilot::EasyEvent->new;
   my $ack = UAV::Pilot::NavCollector::AckEvents->new({
       easy_event => $easy_event,
   });

   $easy_event->add_event( 'nav_ack_on' => sub {
       say "ACK control bit is on";
   });
   $easy_event->add_event( 'nav_ack_off' => sub {
       say "ACK control bit is off";
   });
   $easy_event->add_event( 'nav_ack_toggle' => sub {
       say "ACK control bit toggled";
   });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Does the L<UAV::Pilot::NavCollector> role to fire off events into 
L<UAV::Pilot::EasyEvent> based on the ACK control bit.  Each nav packet with 
the bit on will fire a C<nav_ack_on> event, and C<nav_ack_off> when off.  If 
the state toggles, C<nav_ack_toggle> is sent.
