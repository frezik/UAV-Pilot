=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<AnyEvent> is the standard event framework used for L<UAV::Pilot>.  However, its 
interface isn't convenient for some of the typical things done for UAV piloting.  For 
instance, to put the code into plain English, we might want to say:

    Takeoff, wait 5 seconds, then pitch forward for 2 seconds, then pitch backwards 
    for 2 seconds, then land

In the usual L<AnyEvent> interface, this requires building the timers inside the callbacks 
of other timers, which leads to several levels of indentation.  L<UAV::Pilot::EasyEvent> 
simplifies the handling and syntax of this kind of event workflow.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    new({
        condvar => $cv,
    })

Constructor.  The C<condvar> argument should be an L<AnyEvent::CondVar>.

=head2 add_timer

    add_timer({
        duration       => 100,
        duration_units => $event->UNITS_MILLISECOND,
        cb             => sub { ... },
    })

Add a timer to run in the event loop.  It will run after C<duration> units of time, with 
the units specified by C<duration_units>.  The C<cb> parameter is a reference to a 
subroutine to use as a callback.

Returns a child C<EasyEvent> object.  When the timer above has finished, any timers on 
child objects will be setup for execution.  This makes it easy to chain timers to run 
after each other.

=head2 init_event_loop

This method must be called after running a series of C<add_timer()> calls.  You only need 
to call this on the root object, not the children.

You must call C<recv> on the C<condvar> yourself.

=head1 add_event

  add_event( 'foo', sub {...}, 0 )

Add a subref that will be called when the named event is fired off.  The 
first parameter is the name of the event, and the second is the subref.

The third is optional, and specifies if the call will be a "one-off" or not.  
If it's a one-off, then after the first call to the sub, it will be removed 
from list of callbacks.  Defaults to false.

The callback will receive the arguments that were passed to C<send_event()> 
when the event is triggered.

=head1 send_event

  send_event( 'foo', @args )

Trigger an event with the given name.  The first arg is the name of the event.  
All subsequent args will be passed to the callbacks attached to that event 
name.
