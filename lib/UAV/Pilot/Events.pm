=head1 NAME

  UAV::Pilot::Events

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $condvar = AnyEvent->condvar;
    my $events = UAV::Pilot::Events->new({
        condvar => $condvar,
    });
    $events->register( ... );
    $events->init_event_loop;
    $condvar->recv;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Handles event loops on a regular timer.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    new({
        condvar => $cv,
    })

Constructor.  The C<condvar> argument is an L<AnyEvent::Condvar>.

=head2 register

    register( $event_handler )

Adds a object that does the L<UAV::Pilot::EventHandler> role to the list.  The 
C<process_events> method on that object will be called each time the event loop runs.

=head2 init_event_loop

Sets up the event loop.  Note that you must still call C<recv> on the L<AnyEvent::Condvar> 
to start the loop running.
