=head1 NAME

  UAV::Pilot::Commands

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $device; # Some UAV::Pilot::Control instance, defined elsewhere
    my $cmds = UAV::Pilot::Commands->new({
        device => $device,
        controller_callback_ardrone     => \&make_ardrone_controller,
        controller_callback_wumpusrover => \&make_wumpusrover_controller,
    });
    
    $cmds->load_lib( 'ARDrone' );
    $cmds->run_cmd( 'takeoff;' );
    $cmds->run_cmd( 'land;' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides an interface for loading UAV extensions and running them, particularly for 
REPL shells.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    new({
        condvar                         => $cv,
        controller_callback_ardrone     => sub { ... },
        controller_callback_wumpusrover => sub { .. },
    })

Constructor.  The C<condvar> parameter is an C<AnyEvent::Condvar>.

The C<controller_callback_*> parameters take a sub ref.  The subroutines take 
the parameters C<($cmd, $cv, $easy_event)>, where C<$cmd> is this 
L<UAV::Pilot::Commands> instance, C<$cv> is the condvar passed above, and 
C<$easy_event> is an L<UAV::Pilot::EasyEvent> instance.  It should return a 
L<UAV::Pilot::Control> object of the associated type (generally one of the 
C<*::Event> types with C<init_event_loop()> called).

Note that this API is likely to change to a factory pattern in the near future.

=head2 load_lib

    load_lib( 'ARDrone', {
        pack => 'AR',
    })

Loads an extension by name.  The C<pack> parameter will load the library into a specific 
namespace.  If you don't specify it, you won't need to qualify commands with a namespace 
prefix.  Example:

    load_lib( 'ARDrone', { pack => 'AR' } );
    run_cmd( 'takeoff;' );     # Error: no subroutine named 'takeoff'
    run_cmd( 'AR::takeoff;' ); # This works
    
    load_lib( 'ARDrone' );
    run_cmd( 'takeoff;' );     # Now this works, too

Any other parameters you pass will be passed to the module's C<uav_module_init()> 
subroutine.

=head2 run_cmd

    run_cmd( 'takeoff;' )

Executes a command.  Note that this will execute arbitrary Perl statements.

=head1 COMMANDS

Commands provide an easy interface for writing simple UAV programs in a REPL shell.  
They are usually thin interfaces over a L<UAV::Pilot::Control>.  If you're writing a 
complicated script, it's suggested that you skip this interface and write to the 
L<UAV::Pilot::Control> directly.

=head2 load

    load 'ARDrone', {
        namespace => 'AR',
    };

Direct call to C<load_lib>.  The C<namespace> parameter will load the library 
into a specific namespace.  If you don't specify it, you won't need to qualify 
commands with a namespace prefix.  Example:

    load 'ARDrone', { namespace => 'AR' };
    takeoff;     # Error: no subroutine named 'takeoff'
    AR::takeoff; # This works
    
    load ARDrone;
    takeoff;     # Now this works, too

Any other parameters you pass will be passed to the module's 
C<uav_module_init()> subroutine.

=head1 WRITING YOUR OWN EXTENSIONS

When calling C<load_lib( 'Foo' )>, we look for C<UAV::Pilot::Foo::Commands> 
in the current C<@INC>.

You write them much like any Perl module, but don't use a C<package> 
statement--the package will be controlled by L<UAV::Pilot::Commands> when 
loaded.  Like a Perl module, it should return true as its final statement 
(put a C<1;> at the end).

Likewise, be careful not to make any assumptions about what package you're in. 
Modules may or may not get loaded into different, arbitrary packages.

For ease of use, it's recommended to use function prototypes to reduce the need
for parens.

The method C<uav_module_init()> is called with the package name as the first 
argument.  Subsequent arguments will be the hashref passed to 
C<load()/load_lib()>.  After being called, this sub will be deleted from the 
package.

The method C<uav_module_quit()> is called when the REPL is closing.
