Revision history for perl module UAV::Pilot

0.6 2013-??-??

[EventHandler Interface]
- UAV::Pilot::SDL::EventHandler moved to UAV::Pilot::EventHandler
- UAV::Pilot::Events based on previous UAV::Pilot::SDL::Events, except it 
  doesn't do anything for SDL
- UAV::Pilot::SDL::Events changed to an EventHandler
- All other EventHandler objects and bin/uav* scripts updated to reflect this 
  change

[Other Changes]
- In UAV::Pilot::Control, change the 'sender' param to 'driver'
- Stack handlers passed to UAV::Pilot::Video::H264Decoder.  Note the API change 
  of 'display' to 'displays'
- Stack handlers passed to UAV::Pilot::Driver::ARDrone::Video.  Note the API 
  change of 'handler' to 'handlers'
- 'uav' shell handles dumping video to file while displaying it at the same time
- Implement 'NavCollector' to receive nav packets as they're read from the driver
- SDLNavDisplay implemented as a NavCollector rather than an EventHandler
